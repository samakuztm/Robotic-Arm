# 1/27/2026 2:05 PM - Drew a basic diagram of my model  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

This is going to be my starting point for the robotic arm.

I've listed the main components I plan to use. Anything else from there onwards will be added later on.
I chose steppers for the two bottom degrees of freedom since I assume those will be the points of highest stress.

The rest of the joints could use servos, im sure they'll suffice.


  

# 1/27/2026 2:10 PM - List of Components  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I found some reliable and cheap components on amazon that ill start to CAD my arm from. I need to know the components Ill be using so I think its good to start from here.

Now that I know what im going to use, I can start to CAD.  

# 1/27/2026 3 PM - Created The Base  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I designed the base in solidworks. So far I think it looks good. I added grips to the bottom of each support leg. There's a hole in the middle for the stepper, but considering im going to gear it down, ill have to find a way to add gears onto the frame.

# 2/2/2026 2:14 PM - Made Cad For Stepper  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I completed the CAD for the stepper motor I'll be using. Next up ill probably do the stepper, or find one online, and then design the gears for the stepper.

# 2/2/2026 2:46 PM - Gear Assembly  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Here's my gear train assembly so far. I have a 1:4 ratio and then another 1:4 ratio, which makes it a 1:16 gear ratio.
I think this should be enough for the motor to provide enough torque.

# 2/4/2026 - Designed the First Shoulder Mount  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Made the first shoulder mount where the heavy duty servo will go. It will be the second degree of freedom and will control the most amount of weight.

Let me know how it looks.  

# 2/18/2026 11:23 PM - Created the Arm  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

I created the CAD Design for the first arm that will fit on the base. This should be the third axis of freedom, but also quite possibly the most important.

Ill create the elbow and wrist ones next. Once that is complete I think it'll be safe to call this the first prototype and ill submit for a design review.

Extra: I optimized the design of the arm to remove weight while still keeping it as strong as possible. I did this by cutting out a shape from the arm.

# 2/18/2026 11:29 PM - Updated the Cart and Researched Items  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

So I spent a couple of hours researching the best servo motors, stepper motors, gear ratios, screws, and just general methods of putting together 3d printed parts.

I pulled out some extra strong servos, mainly one for the arm which will be handling the most weight.

I also added some heat threaded inserts so that the screws could screw into them instead of plastic which could wear out or break rather easily.


This is my latest list of items ill need for this build. If you see anything that could be changed please let me know!

P.S: I didn't choose aliexpress links for some of these because they're either just costlier with shipping fees or are basically the same price. The servo motors and electronics are also mostly the same. So I guess its better to stick with amazon since it'll be more reliable and i can easily return if something goes wrong.

# 2/18/2026 11:35 PM - Created the Elbow  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Designed the eblow piece. Now all that's left is the claw and wrist!.

This piece will use one of the normal 25kg servos on the arm, I think that should be enough since its only really rotating the claw. But it'll have the additional weight of the servo there so should still be strong.
